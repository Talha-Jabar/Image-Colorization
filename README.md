# Image Colorization

This repository contains a machine learning project on **Image Colorization**, where grayscale images are automatically converted to colored images using deep learning models.

## Project Overview
Image colorization is a challenging computer vision task where the model learns to predict the most likely colors for a given grayscale image. This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for the colorization process.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model consists of various grayscale images with their corresponding color images. Ensure the dataset is properly prepared and loaded in the Jupyter notebook.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd image-colorization
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Image_Colorization.ipynb
   ```
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and test the model.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Results
The trained model achieves decent results on various test images. The notebook provides visualization of both the grayscale input and the predicted colorized output.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance the model architecture to improve colorization accuracy.
- Experiment with different datasets and loss functions.
- Add a pre-trained model for quick inference.
